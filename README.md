## What are Recommendation Systems

Recommendation System is an algorithm that can suggest products based on user or item activities.

Types:

- **Content-based** - These systems are based on the characteristics of the items themselves
- **Collaborative Filtering** - These systems use a collection of user ratings of items to make recommendations. Users
  with similar interests will receive recommendations based on previous users viewing.
- **Hybrid** - These systems use the content-based and collaborative filtering to form a more powerful recommendation system.
